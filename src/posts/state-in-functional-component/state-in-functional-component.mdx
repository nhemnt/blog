In this article I want to show you how to use state in functional component in React.

But first let me give you a brief introduction to React Hooks from the [documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html):

## What is hooks?

Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class.


This example renders a counter. When you click the button, it increments the value:


<div className ="code">

 ```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
 ``` 
 
 </div>


Here, **useState** is a Hook. We call it inside a function component to add some local state to it. React will preserve this state between re-renders. useState returns a pair: the current state value and a function that lets you update it. You can call this function from an event handler or somewhere else. It’s similar to this.setState in a class, except it doesn’t merge the old and new state together. 

The only argument to useState is the initial state. In the example above, it is 0 because our counter starts from zero. Note that unlike this.state, the state here doesn’t have to be an object — although it can be if you want. The initial state argument is only used during the first render.


## Declaring multiple state variables

You can use the State Hook more than once in a single component:

<div className ="code">

 ```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    function ExampleWithManyStates() {
    // Declare multiple state variables!
    const [name, setName] = useState("Hemant Negi");
    const [age, setAge] = useState(25);
    const [favFood, handleFavFood] = useState(
      ["Pizza", "Chole Bhature", "Cheeseburger"]);
    // ...
  }
  );
}
 ``` 
 
 </div>


## How to use state in functional component?

Now we can use setState in functional component by using hooks. Here we are using **setState** using **useState** in functional component.


<div className ="code">

 ```javascript

import React, { useState } from "react"

const intialState = {
  name: "Hemant Negi",
  age: 25,
  github: "https://github.com/nhemnt",
}

function StateInFunctionalComponent() {
  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "state"
  const [state, setState] = useState(intialState)

  const handleChange = event => {
    const { name, value } = event.target
    setState({
      ...state,
      [name]: value,
    })
  }
  const { name, age, github } = state
  return (
    <div>
      <p>
        <span>Name: </span>{" "}
        <input type="text" name="name" onChange={handleChange} value={name} />
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>Age: </span>{" "}
        <input type="text" name="age" onChange={handleChange} value={age} />
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>Github: </span>{" "}
        <input type="text" name="github" onChange={handleChange} value={github} />
      </p>
    </div>
  )
}

 ``` 
 
 </div>




## Rules of Hooks
Hooks are JavaScript functions, but they impose two additional rules:

1. Only call Hooks at the top level. Don’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.
2. Only call Hooks from React function components. Don’t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions.
